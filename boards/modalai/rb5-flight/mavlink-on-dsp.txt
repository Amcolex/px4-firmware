Work items for mavlink dsp bridge
---------------------------------

1. Notes
    - We configure mavlink for UDP but it then goes over serial. Mavlink needs to understand that.

2. Mavlink tuning
    - max_num_to_send in MavlinkParametersManager::send()
    - timeout in MavlinkReceiver::Run()
    - "-r" option in mavlink start
        - This is _datarate in mavlink_main.cpp
            - Used to calculate _main_loop_delay
            - Used to calculate bandwith_mult

3. Mavlink logging at QGC
    - Temporary logs are stored in /tmp/FlightData....mavlink
    - Enable saving of logs in QGC application settings for "Telemetry logs from vehicle"
    - Logs are stored in ~/Documents/QGroundControl/Telemetry/*.tlog
    - Analyze with mavlogdump.py

4. Parameter sending
    - There are 580+ "used" parameters! Why so many??? (It's only the "used" parameters)
    - If the parameter send rate is too high, many parameters get lost
    - If the parameter rate is too low, QGC times out before entire list is received

5. Test
    - SW throttling at Mavlink
    - Verify no UART errors reported by OS in flight_controller_sensor instance
    - Is FTDI read latency too high for QGC connection? (See HITL issues)

6. Issues
    - Fix that whole git_mavlink_v2 custom target cmake thing on fresh build
    - Update px4-alias.sh and create symlink for mavlink_bridge
    - QGC does not handle LINK_NODE_STATUS mavlink message
